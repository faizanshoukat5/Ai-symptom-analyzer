## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously at MedAI Advanced. If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly.

### üîí How to Report

1. **Email**: Send details to security@medai-advanced.com
2. **GitHub**: Use [Security Advisories](https://github.com/yourusername/medai-advanced/security/advisories) (preferred)
3. **Encrypted**: Use our PGP key for sensitive reports

### üìã What to Include

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested fix (if known)
- Your contact information

### ‚è±Ô∏è Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 24 hours
- **Assessment**: Within 72 hours
- **Fix Timeline**: Depends on severity
  - Critical: 1-7 days
  - High: 1-14 days
  - Medium: 2-30 days
  - Low: Next release cycle

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Measures

### Data Protection
- **No Data Storage**: Symptoms are processed in real-time and not stored
- **Local Processing**: AI models run locally, no cloud dependencies
- **Secure API**: FastAPI with proper authentication and validation
- **Input Sanitization**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized

### Medical Data Security
- **HIPAA Considerations**: Designed with healthcare privacy standards
- **No PHI Storage**: No personally identifiable health information is stored
- **Secure Communication**: HTTPS enforcement in production
- **Access Controls**: Proper API rate limiting and access controls

### Infrastructure Security
- **Dependencies**: Regular security audits of npm and pip dependencies
- **Code Scanning**: Automated security scanning in CI/CD
- **Environment Variables**: Secure handling of API keys and secrets
- **Docker Security**: Secure container configurations

## üîß Security Best Practices

### For Users
- Keep your system updated
- Use strong, unique passwords for any accounts
- Don't share sensitive medical information over insecure channels
- Verify the source before downloading

### For Developers
- Regular dependency updates
- Security-first code reviews
- Proper error handling (no sensitive data in logs)
- Secure API endpoint design
- Input validation and sanitization

## üö® Known Security Considerations

### AI Model Security
- **Model Integrity**: Verify model checksums when downloading
- **Prompt Injection**: Input validation prevents malicious prompts
- **Model Bias**: Ongoing monitoring for biased or inappropriate responses
- **Resource Limits**: Proper limits to prevent DoS attacks

### Medical Context
- **Disclaimer Requirements**: All outputs include appropriate medical disclaimers
- **Emergency Detection**: Critical symptoms trigger clear emergency guidance
- **Professional Oversight**: System designed to complement, not replace, medical professionals

## üìû Emergency Contacts
