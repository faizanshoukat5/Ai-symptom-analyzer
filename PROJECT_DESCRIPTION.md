# AI Symptom Analyzer - Project Description

## üè• About This Project

**AI Symptom Analyzer** is a cutting-edge medical AI platform that transforms how people understand their health symptoms. Built with modern web technologies and powered by multiple advanced AI models, this application provides instant, intelligent symptom analysis with clinical-grade accuracy.

The platform combines **React** for a sleek, medical-grade user interface with **FastAPI** backend services that orchestrate multiple biomedical AI models including BioGPT, ClinicalBERT, and specialized Named Entity Recognition systems. Users simply describe their symptoms in natural language, and the AI provides comprehensive analysis including severity assessment, medical recommendations, urgency scoring, and guidance on when to seek professional medical care.

**Key Innovation:** Unlike single-model approaches, our system uses an ensemble of 7+ specialized medical AI models that work together to provide more accurate and reliable health insights. The application features real-time processing, interactive visualizations, and a professional interface designed specifically for healthcare contexts.

**Perfect for:** Healthcare professionals seeking AI-assisted preliminary assessment tools, medical students learning symptom analysis, researchers in medical AI, and individuals wanting intelligent health guidance before consulting healthcare providers.

**Technology Stack:** React 19, TypeScript, FastAPI, Python, Firebase, Multiple HuggingFace Transformers, TailwindCSS, and modern deployment platforms.
