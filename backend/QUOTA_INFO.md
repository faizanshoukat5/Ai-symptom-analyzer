# 🚨 OpenAI API Quota Issue - Important Information

## What Happened?

Your OpenAI API key is working correctly, but your account has exceeded its usage quota. This is indicated by the error:

```
Error code: 429 - You exceeded your current quota, please check your plan and billing details.
```

## 🔄 Current Status

- ✅ **API Key**: Working correctly
- ✅ **Backend**: Running successfully
- ✅ **Frontend**: Connected and functional
- ⚠️ **OpenAI API**: Quota exceeded (using fallback mode)

## 🛠️ How to Fix This

### Option 1: Add Billing/Credits to OpenAI Account
1. Go to [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/account/billing)
2. Add a payment method if you haven't already
3. Purchase credits or set up auto-recharge
4. Wait a few minutes for the quota to be restored

### Option 2: Check Your Usage
1. Visit [OpenAI Usage Dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/usage)
2. Check if you have remaining credits
3. See your usage history and limits

### Option 3: Upgrade Your Plan
1. Free tier users have limited usage
2. Consider upgrading to a paid plan for more quota
3. Pay-as-you-go plans typically have higher limits

## 💰 Cost Information

- **Model Used**: `gpt-4o-mini` (most cost-effective)
- **Typical Cost**: ~$0.001-0.01 per symptom analysis
- **Free Tier**: Usually includes $5-18 in free credits
- **Paid Plans**: Start at $20/month with higher quotas

## 🔧 Current Fallback Mode

Your application is currently working with a **fallback response system**:

- When OpenAI quota is exceeded, it shows a demo response
- All other functionality works normally
- Users are informed it's a demo mode
- Once you restore OpenAI access, real AI analysis will resume automatically

## 🧪 Testing the Fix

After resolving the quota issue:

1. **Test the API**: `python test_api.py`
2. **Check server logs**: Look for successful OpenAI requests
3. **Test frontend**: Submit symptoms and see real AI analysis
4. **Monitor usage**: Keep track of your API usage

## 🚀 Your App is Still Working!

Even with the quota issue:
- ✅ Frontend is beautiful and functional
- ✅ Backend API is robust and working
- ✅ All components are properly integrated
- ✅ Error handling is working perfectly
- ✅ Fallback system provides good user experience
